	--Not just this, Jon Prosser, in collaboration with Ian Zelbo, has released a set of renders of the upcoming Macbook Air 2021 in a blue colour option. The bezels appear to be substantially reduced in the renders, as hinted in previous leaks. Also, a white keypad has been used that goes with the blue colour option. We may see Macbook Air 2021 in Yellow, Green, Silver and more colours apart from the Blue colour.
