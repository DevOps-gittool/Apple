With so many Apple devices floating around, it can be difficult to keep track of which tablet, computer, or phone is the most recent.

	That's especially true of the iPad family, where there are not only plenty of different models, but also plenty of different generations.

There are four different models of the iPad currently available: 

the iPad Mini,

the iPad, 

the iPad Air, 

and the iPad Pro. 

Among the four of them, there are three different generations, and we may soon be getting yet another set of updates.
